# Black_Hat_Python_Improved 

# This repo is designed to build on the great work found in the book Black Hat Python by:
# Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold

# The goal is that the expanded explinations and sources sited within this repo will 
# allow new students of the Python language to better understand the concepts demonstrated.
# Additionally, as Python has been updated there have been new recommendations on how to 
# preform tasks.
